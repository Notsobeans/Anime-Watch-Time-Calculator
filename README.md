# Anime Watch Time Calculator

Orginally I made this in Python, but after learning a bit of C# I decided to remake the program in C#. Though I'll be honest, I ended up just feeding ChatGPT features to add, so the finished product is just coded by ChatGPT.

Here's what the program does:

This program allows you to input the details of various anime series, including episode count and average episode duration, and calculates the total time required to watch them. You can also specify if there are sequels or spin-offs and include them in the total time calculation. The program organizes and sorts the anime entries by the highest to lowest total time for easy reference.

The program also creates a folder called "Anime Calculations" in the user's documents folder, and saves the data from each anime entered as a text file and then puts that text file in the folder.

Feel free to use this program to track your anime calculate watch time efficiently and ensure you have enough time to enjoy your favorite series!
